#
# Environment Configuration for Stella-Next
# 
# IMPORTANT: This project uses centralized environment configuration.
# The authoritative .env file should be located in the backend/ directory.
#
# To set up your environment:
# 1. Copy backend/.env.example to backend/.env
# 2. Edit backend/.env with your API keys
# 3. Both ./start_api.sh and the backend will use backend/.env
#
# This approach ensures consistency across all components.
